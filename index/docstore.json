Tax has pervaded all walks of society \nas consumers, workers and stakeholders are keen to \nunderstand the tangible fiscal contribution made by the \nbusinesses they interact with in this ecosystem. This \ninput goes into the choices they make. The spirit of the tax \ncomponent pertaining to ESG is governed by a penchant \nfor a progressively fair share of taxes rather than merely \nbeing paying taxes that fall due under the current fiscal \nframework. The needle has evidently moved from minimal \ntax to fair tax.\nJSW Steel Group believes that as a corporate citizen it has \nresponsibilities towards the society. These responsibilities \ninclude constantly endeavoring to make the world a better \nplace to live. We aim to achieve these by focusing on our \nESG goals and objectives. JSW Steel Group is a pioneer \nin persistently taking steps towards these ESG goals and \nobjectives. We have embedded tax transparency as one of \nthe significant ESG goal and towards this, we are releasing \nour first Tax Transparency Report (Report) for FY 2021-22. \nTax transparency is increasingly seen as a method of \ndemonstrating contribution to society and sustainability. \nBy way of this Report, we aim to transparently share with our stakeholders, the key aspects of our tax affairs and \nour contribution by way of taxes to the exchequer. At \nJSW Steel Group, we are sticklers for transparency and \nas such a complete disclosure to all our stakeholders is \nof paramount importance. Our aim, through this Report, \nis to transparently disclose to our stakeholders our tax \nprinciples based on which tax laws are complied in various \njurisdictions where we operate. We have also captured \ntotal tax contributions made by the JSW Group in India as \nwell as the overseas jurisdictions. We have also captured \ntax governance framework which lays down the tax policy \nas well as other internal controls followed by the JSW Group \nwhile meeting the tax obligations.\nThis is the first Report released by the Company to reflect \nits commitment towards transparent disclosure of our tax \nframework.

It is a key source of revenue for any \ngovernment and fuels economic growth and sustainability \nfor the nation\u2019s leading to prosperity for the citizens.\nCovid-19 pandemic has left an almost unsurmountable \nand unruly impact on the global economy. The lockdowns \nled to massive loss of livelihood, employment as well as \ncommercial output, adversely impacting the revenue \nflow for the governments throughout the world. With \nthis perspective, the collection and payment of fair and \njust taxes by the corporate citizens is a bare minimum \nrequirement and we at JSW are committed to ensure \ntransparent and progressive contribution to this socio-\neconomic objective. \nAs a responsible business house, with global footprint in \n100+ countries, employing more than 23,000 people, we \npursue a holistic tax policy that focuses on paying fair taxes in each of the jurisdictions we operate in. We strive \nto be transparent to our stakeholders on our approach \ntowards tax and compliance with regulatory requirements \nin the countries of our operation. We believe in sharing the \ntax strategy followed by the Company, in order to build and \nmaintain trust and credibility with our internal as well as \nexternal stakeholders. \nIn line with the above, we are glad to present our first Tax \nTransparency Report for the year ending March 2022.

We strictly comply with the applicable laws and \nregulations of each country in letter and spirit.\nWe have an in-house team of competent tax professionals \nwho monitor the tax positions adopted by the JSW Steel \nGroup entities. The Company has internal tax framework \nwhich mandates independent evaluation on tax matters \nfrom technical and legal perspective coupled with analysing \nrisk assessment. This tax framework is consistently \nfollowed on all tax matters including matters related to \ntransfer pricing, local income tax, cross-border taxation \nand indirect tax matters. While adopting tax position on any \nunique matter involving contentious issues, the Company \nseeks external guidance and the tax position adopted are \nbacked by the opinions of expert professionals and tax \nconsultants having subject matter expertise. In case of \nany divergent views on a particular transaction, we consult \nsenior legal counsels before taking a tax position. Open \ntax matters are reviewed periodically and presented on a \nquarterly basis to Audit Committee.\nWhile adopting a tax position, a detailed evaluation is done \non \u201cmore likely than not\u201d chances of success before the \nappellate forums. In case any new tax position is agreed \nupon or any existing position is revised, a detailed internal \nanalysis backed with technical propositions is done and \npresented to the Financial Controller and/ or CFO of the \nCompany. After their agreement, such tax position is \nimplemented by the Company. The key tax positions are \nalso discussed with the Board Committee on Finance. \nOur tax teams are carefully monitoring the developments \naround new taxes in key jurisdictions where we have \ncustomers and vendors. The tax team keeps providing \nperiodical updates to the Financial Controller and/ or CFO \nand takes guidance on complex issues.\nWe follow the OECD framework along with the domestic \nlaws relevant to transfer pricing of goods and services \namong our group entities. We do not use jurisdictions \nclassified as tax havens or low tax jurisdictions for \ndiverting profits. If as part of any acquisition there are \nentities in low tax jurisdictions, we are in the process \nof streamlining the overall historically acquired holding \nstructure from tax perspective. Through our group tax policy, we commit to abide by the \nfollowing aspects:\n\u2022  We endeavor to comply with the letter and spirit of the \ntax laws and regulations of the countries in which we \noperate in.\n\u2022  We have a strict resistance against shifting profits to \nlow tax jurisdictions.\n\u2022  We refrain from creating cross border tax structures \nwithout any commercial substance.\n\u2022  We undertake related party transactions, both \ndomestic and international, on arm\u2019s length basis.\n\u2022  We do not use jurisdictions classified as tax havens \nfor tax avoidance.\nAs a part of the Company\u2019s tax risk management procedure:\n\u2022  Our tax team remains abreast of developments in the \ntax regulations and jurisprudence relevant to the tax \nmatters of the Company. \n\u2022  In case any change in a material key predetermined tax \nposition is anticipated on account of developments in \nlaw or jurisprudence, the tax position is re-visited by \nthe tax team \n\u2022  Consultations are sought from external tax advisors \nif any change in tax position is envisaged\n\u2022  If necessary, the tax positions are revised after \ndeliberation with the Board Committee on Finance. \nFor instance, the Government of India had, vide Finance \nAct 2022, introduced new provisions for withholding of \ntax under section 194R of the Income-tax Act, 1961 with \neffect from  July 01, 2022. As per the said provisions, \nthe Company is liable to withhold tax in case any benefit \nor perquisite is provided by the Company in the course \nof its business. This amendment to the law potentially \nincreased the tax compliance and in some cases the tax \ncost of the Company. As a proactive response, in-line \nwith the Company\u2019s tax risk management procedures, \nthe tax team critically analysed the applicability of the \nprovisions to various trade practices of the Company in \ntandem with the external tax advisors and consulted the \nbusiness development team of the Company on the steps \nand checks to be ensured for due compliance with the \nnew provisions. \n7", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4422, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97577262-b835-49aa-9b07-5985d5b68922": {"__data__": {"id_": "97577262-b835-49aa-9b07-5985d5b68922", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_10.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder\\page_10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 27501, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "page_10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_10.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder\\page_10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 27501, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "4e5de3c743e80f73c8c6827a1c7938d733c39fbf069c5e08035767c259ec5bf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40ff6e79-d4df-4fb5-8bf8-40bdcc70041d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "page_9.pdf", "file_path": "output_folder\\page_9.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 28361, "creation_date": "2024-04-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-12"}, "hash": "a0d61140c765349de60241c14ea5ee4dbc4008dd61170d72b86a8b8149457941", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ed50021-c6c3-4159-9db2-d56b545df547", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b9d97c426ee0ae5c3014009d1cfc8c4a723261e6d6c4b28008b71ed3b4fa15f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Principal driving the overall \ntax functions\nTotal tax contribution to \nthe exchequer\nDisclosures to be made from \ntax perspective for benefit of all \nthe stakeholderAttitude towards tax planning\nTax incentives and evaluate \neligibility to avail it\nRepresentation to be made to the \ngovernment authorities through \ntrade associations or otherwiseTax practices including \ntax compliances\nRelationship with the \ntax authoritiesThe Company adopts a proactive action in case of any change in law or judicial views impact their predetermined tax \npositions causing a tax risk to the Company.
